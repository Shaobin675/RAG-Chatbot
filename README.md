RAG-Based AI Chatbot (Ongoing Project)

This repository contains an ongoing AI chatbot project built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) principles.
The system is designed using a microservice-friendly architecture, optimized for I/O-bound workloads, and intended to scale to high-concurrency, multi-user environments.
